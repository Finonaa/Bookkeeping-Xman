# Bookkeeping-Xman
Filecoin Allocator: [Xman ]
Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for transparency and operations for [Xman], a dedicated DataCap allocator within the Filecoin Plus (Fil+) ecosystem.

Filecoin Plus is a layer of social trust built on top of the Filecoin network to incentivize the storage of real, valuable data. Clients apply for DataCap, which they can use to pay for storage deals with miners. These deals, once verified, provide miners with a 10x block reward multiplier, creating a powerful incentive to store useful data.

As a Verified Registry Client, we are entrusted with DataCap by the Filecoin Foundation. Our mission is to allocate this resource responsibly to legitimate clients who demonstrate a genuine need to store valuable data on the Filecoin network, thereby fostering its growth and utility.

1.Pathway Description
Our allocation process is designed to be transparent, fair, and efficient. Clients seeking DataCap must follow these steps:

Initial Application:

Submit a formal request via our dedicated channel (e.g., GitHub Issue, Google Form, etc.): [https://github.com/Finonaa/Bookkeeping-Xman/].

The application must include:

Project Description: Clear explanation of the data to be stored and its value/utility.

Technical Details: Data size, format, and preferred miners (if any).

Client On-Chain Address: The Filecoin address to receive the DataCap.

Verification Plan: How you intend to verify the data's storage and availability over time.

Due Diligence & Review:

Our team will review the application for completeness and legitimacy.

We may request a meeting or further documentation to understand the project's scope and the client's needs.


Decision & Allocation:

A decision (Approve, Deny, or Request More Information) will be made based on our internal policy and any community input.

All decisions and their justifications will be documented publicly in this repository.

Post-Allocation Monitoring:

Clients are expected to report on the status of their deals. Failure to utilize allocated DataCap within a reasonable timeframe may impact future requests.

2.Contact Information

For all inquiries related to DataCap allocation, please use the following channels. This ensures all communication is trackable and transparent. 

General Questions & Discussion: Filecoin Slack Channel [Slack ID:Xman] 

3.Allocation Policy

Our core principle is to maximize the utility of the Filecoin network by supporting clients storing verifiably useful and unique data.

We prioritize:

Open Datasets: Publicly accessible data for research, science, and public good.

Cultural & Historical Preservation: Archives, libraries, and museums.

Decentralized Applications (dApps): Projects building on or integrating with Filecoin.

New Storage Clients: Clients new to the network who need a bootstrap allocation.

Geographic Diversity: Clients and miners from underrepresented regions.

We generally avoid or scrutinize heavily:

Requests to allocate to a single miner without a justified technical reason.

Requests from anonymous entities without a verifiable track record.

Projects that appear to be solely for financial arbitrage rather than genuine storage.

Data that is illegal, malicious, or violates the Fil+ principles.

Allocation Tiers:

Small Request (ï¼œ5TiB): Streamlined review process.

Large Request (> 5 TiB): Requires enhanced due diligence, a public notice period for community feedback, and a clear justification for the large amount.

4.Risk Mitigation Approach

We employ a multi-layered strategy to mitigate the risk of DataCap misuse:

Progressive Decentralization: Start with smaller allocations to new clients and increase based on proven, trustworthy usage.

Miner Diversity Requirement: We encourage and often require clients to spread their deals across multiple reputable miners to strengthen network resilience and prevent concentration of trust.

Transparency as a Deterrent: The public nature of our application and decision-making process acts as a strong deterrent against bad actors.

Data Verification: We perform spot checks on stored data to ensure it matches the client's description and remains retrievable.

Notary Oversight: We operate under the guidance and rules set by the Filecoin Foundation and the broader Notary community, incorporating their feedback and alert into our processes.

5.Dispute Resolution Process

In the event of a dispute (e.g., a client believes their application was unfairly rejected, or a third party raises a concern about an allocation):

Formal Complaint: The concerned party must submit a formal complaint via a GitHub Issue in this repository using the Dispute template, clearly outlining the grounds for the dispute.

Acknowledgment & Investigation: We will acknowledge the issue within 48 hours and initiate a review of the original application and decision process.

Transparent Discussion: The issue will be discussed transparently within the GitHub thread, allowing all parties to present evidence.

Resolution Proposal: Our team will propose a resolution (e.g., uphold decision, reverse decision, propose a compromise).

Escalation: If the dispute cannot be resolved internally, we will escalate the matter to the Filecoin Foundation or the designated Fil+ governance body for a final ruling. We agree to abide by their decision.

6.Audit Plan

To ensure ongoing accountability and adherence to our stated policies, we commit to the following:

Public Ledger: All allocation decisions, including client address, amount, rationale, and associated GitHub issue link, will be recorded in a allocations.csv file in this repository.


Community Audits: We welcome and encourage independent audits from any community member. Findings can be submitted as a GitHub Issue.

Notary Compliance: We will fully comply with any audit requests from the Filecoin Foundation or our designated root key holder.
